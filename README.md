Hello there! You've come to my repository about Formula 1 World Championship, which is one of the most prestigious motorsport discipline and is spectated by millions of people worldwide on live, TV or online sources.

As a data science enthusiast and have been following F1 for almost two decades, my objective here is to prepare the datasets to enable analyses on drivers and teams in terms of their race results throughout the seasons.

All these data are obtained from Formula 1 Official [Web Site](https://www.formula1.com/), plus Codemasters F1 Games.

## Featured Datasets

Here are the datasets you can find:

- 2019 Season Race Results (All Races)
- 2019 Season Drivers
- 2019 Season Race Tracks
- 2020 Season Race Results (All Races)
- 2020 Season Drivers
- 2020 Season Race Calendar
- 2020 Season Driver Ratings from Codemasters F1 2020 Official Video Game (Initial, October 2020 & January 2021)

## Future Plans

I'm planning to add more datasets which contain results from previous seasons (2018 and before).

The 2021 season is ongoing, thus race results will be included to the corresponding dataset over time.
