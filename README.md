Hello there! Here is my dataset project about Formula 1 World Championship, which is one of the most prestigious motorsport discipline and is spectated by millions of people worldwide on live, TV or online sources.

As I like data science nowadays and have been following F1 for over a decade, then I've decided to create some appropriate datasets to enable analyses on drivers and teams in terms of their performances throughout the seasons.

All these data are obtained from Formula 1 Official [Web Site](https://www.formula1.com/).

### Featured Datasets

In the beginning, there are three datasets uploaded here:

- 2020 Driver Ratings from Codemasters F1 2020 Official Video Game
- 2019 Season Race Results
- 2019 Season Drivers
- 2019 Season Race Tracks
- 2020 Season Race Results (11 out of 17 Races)

**Applied data analysis is now available for 2019 Season!** Please click on the related file to inspect: _F1_2019season_analysis.ipynb_.

### Future Plans

I'm planning to add more datasets which contain results from previous seasons.

When more races are completed for 2020 Season, they will be available in the corresponding dataset.
