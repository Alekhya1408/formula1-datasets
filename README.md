Hello there! Here is my dataset project about Formula 1 World Championship, which is one of the most prestigious motorsport discipline and is spectated by millions of people worldwide on live, TV or online sources.

As I like data science nowadays and have been following F1 for over a decade, then I've decided to create some appropriate datasets to enable analyses on drivers and teams in terms of their race results throughout the seasons.

All these data are obtained from Formula 1 Official [Web Site](https://www.formula1.com/), plus Codemasters F1 Games.

### Featured Datasets

Here are the datasets uploaded:

- 2019 Season Race Results (All Races)
- 2019 Season Drivers
- 2019 Season Race Tracks
- 2020 Season Race Results (14 out of 17 Races)
- 2020 Driver Ratings from Codemasters F1 2020 Official Video Game (including October 2020 rating update)

**Applied data analysis is now available for 2019 Season!** Please click on the related file to inspect: _F1_2019season_analysis.ipynb_.

### Future Plans

I'm planning to add more datasets which contain results from previous seasons.

Moreover, when more races are completed for 2020 Season, they will be available in the corresponding dataset.
